This is a personal site where I share my projects, as well as tidbits from my ventures. I mainly focus on lower-level stuff related to GPU's, assembly, and language and compiler design. I'm currently working on an x64 assembler, which I eventually hope to optimize enough for it to be a viable competitor to [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). My long-term goal is building a performant compiler backend/IR, which supports both sequential and massively parallel architectures (CPU/GPU/other).
