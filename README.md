## Website 
This repository contains the assets for my personal [website and blog](https://www.goubermouche.com/). The HTML files are generated from markdown files located in `/content/` using my markdown compiler (which is still under development, but I'll probably make it public in the upcoming month).

The style and feel of my website is inspired by the [fantastic BST writeup](https://rtheunissen.github.io/bst/) by Rudi Theunissen.
